Student Dropout Prediction - Machine Learning Project
Overview
Student dropout is a major issue in the education sector, affecting both institutions and students. Early identification of at-risk students can help implement timely interventions. This project uses machine learning to predict student dropout rates based on academic performance, socio-economic background, and behavioral factors.
Problem Definition
The goal is to develop a predictive model that identifies students at risk of dropping out using various academic, socio-economic, and behavioral indicators. By leveraging machine learning, institutions can take proactive steps to reduce dropout rates and improve student retention.
Objectives
Develop a predictive model to classify students based on their likelihood of dropping out.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into dropout patterns.
Preprocess data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Train and compare multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing algorithm.
Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
Deploy the trained model as an API using FastAPI for real-time predictions.
Data Description
Source: Educational dataset containing student demographics, academic performance, financial background, and engagement levels.
Structure: CSV format with features including: 
oDemographic Information: Age, gender, nationality, parental education.
oAcademic Performance: GPA, exam scores, course completion rates.
oBehavioral Data: Attendance records, engagement levels, disciplinary records.
oSocio-Economic Factors: Scholarship status, employment status.
oTarget Variable: Dropout status (1 = Dropped out, 0 = Continued).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is conducted to understand data distributions, detect missing values, and identify key trends:
Visualizations: Histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
Missing Values Handling: Imputation strategies applied where necessary.
Feature Correlations: Analysis of relationships between features and dropout rates.
Class Imbalance Detection: Identifying whether dropout cases are underrepresented.
Preprocessing
Handling missing values via imputation.
Standardizing numerical variables.
Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Splitting dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
Addressing class imbalances using SMOTE or class weighting.
Model Implementation
Several machine learning models are trained and compared:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search & Random Search: Used for optimizing hyperparameters.
Cross-Validation: Applied to improve model generalization.
Evaluation
Performance Metrics: 
oAccuracy
oPrecision, Recall, F1-score
oAUC-ROC curve for classification effectiveness
Visualization Techniques: 
oConfusion Matrix
oROC and Precision-Recall Curves
oFeature Importance Analysis
Baseline Comparison: 
oPerformance evaluated against a simple rule-based classifier.
Deployment
Model is deployed as an API using FastAPI to enable real-time predictions.

API Functionality
